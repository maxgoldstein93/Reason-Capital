        <h1  id="#about">About US</h1>
        <p class="about us">Reason is a North American focused private investment firm that manages a series of diversified
            partnerships that sponsor leveraged buyouts of middle market companies exhibiting viable, intriguing and
            compelling business opportunities. On a very selective basis, we serve as a lead investor in venture capital
            stage companies. We operate coast to coast, with our main offices strategically located in New York, New
            York and Santa Monica, California.

            Reason is a long term value oriented investor that partners with experienced management teams in acquiring,
            developing, or improving leading companiesâ€™ performances. Our internally developed performance models, based
            on portfolio company(s) profitability, have helped us to achieve superior returns. The end results enriches
            our capital base, provides superior returns to our partners and allows us to attract and retain a talented
            team of professionals. Our principals and the majority of our staff average more than twenty years in
            transactional and operating experience. Our goal is to continue to build a strong record of successful
            completed transactions and to generate substantial long-term value for our partners.

            Reason is a value-oriented, non industry selective investor, with significant relationships that span across
            many different business segments. We continually strive to discover strong, long-term investments that will
            provide superior risk-adjusted returns for our investors. Reason purposely focuses our attention towards
            assets that fit into one of two boxes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Traditional Companies run by strong managers with superior or recognizable brand names, competitive
                positions protected by barriers to entry, robust free cash flow and sustainable future growth outlooks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Non Traditional: Situations characterized as opportunistic, complex and/or convoluted transactions
                involving underperforming companies. In many cases they are turnaround companies that show promise; have
                underachieving balance sheets; past, present or future litigation issues or environmental problems or
                are categorized as special situations.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When we find a company that meets our standards, we are quick and aggressive in our efforts to secure the
            transaction. What distinguishes us from others is the extreme flexibility and creativity we exhibit in
            structuring those transactions and our follow through as a value-added partner. The record shows that the
            Reason our portfolio companies have patiently and steadily grown was based upon the right combination of
            perseverance, vision and capital.
